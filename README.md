## team-profile-generator

## Overview:

This assignment involves the continued use of node.js.

For this assignment, you will find the steps needed and, ultimately, the creation of a software engineering team generator through command line efforts. The application prompts the user to enter specific information relevant to each team member (manager, engineer and intern). Upon completion of the submitted team member information, the team profile is then built, and the application creates an HTML file that displays the team roster which includes said information provided by the user.

The unit covered for this assignment also included the use of unit testing. For this assignment, unit tests were also performed and all passed. We have now learned that this is a requirement and essential for an effectively ran application. Please see the test results screenshot below for more information regarding this aspect of the project.

For more information regarding the aforementioned application, please see below. Thank you.
